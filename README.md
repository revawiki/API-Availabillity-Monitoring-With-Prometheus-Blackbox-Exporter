# API-Availabillity-Monitoring-With-Prometheus-Blackbox-Exporter
This project was created as a solution-based approch for monitoring API Availabillity. Metrics to be shown in the visualization includes up/down status, SLA percentage, and hit latency. Project was created using Prometheus + Blackbox Exporter with Grafana running on Docker. Grafana API was used as the targeted API. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Installing and Running ACS-Stack

Guide to set-up ACS-stacks.

1. Install Docker & Docker-Compose if it hasn't been installed on your machine and run it.\
[Docker Install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & [Docker-Compose Install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. Build GenieACS Docker image following guidance from [drumsergio/genieacs](https://github.com/DrumSergio/genieacs-docker#pullbuild-dockerfile)
```
$ docker build -f GenieACS.dockerfile . -t drumsergio/genieacs:local
```

3. Clone this repository into your machine.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/revawiki/ACS-Stack-For-CPE-Statistics-Monitoring
```

4. Go to the cloned directory, and execute the bashfile.
```
$ ./up.sh
```

### Pre-steps for CPE-ACS Connectivity
1. From GenieACS web interface (http://localhost:3001), configure CPE to ACS authentication refering to [this guide](https://github.com/genieacs/genieacs/wiki/GenieACS-Auth-Config#cpe-to-acs-in-version-120).

2. From CPE console/gui configuration, adjust the CPE's TR069 connection settings.

3. Back to GenieACS web interface, overwrite the default provision script using the script provided [here](https://github.com/revawiki/ACS-Stack-For-CPE-Statistics-Monitoring/blob/master/script/provision-script.js).

4. [Restart](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/restart/) the GenieACS docker service.

5. Access the visualization dashboard via (http://localhost:3000).
